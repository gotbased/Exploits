# Exploits

CVEsploit:
A Python script for CVE information retrieval using Metasploit.

Description:
CVEsploit is a Python script that leverages the Metasploit Framework to search for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data. Simply provide a list of CVE identifiers, and the script queries Metasploit for matching modules, including auxiliaries. It generates CSV files with results, listing matching modules for each CVE and available auxiliary modules.

Features:

CVE Check Search: Find modules supporting checks for a specific CVE to ensure system safety.
CVE All Search: Retrieve all modules associated with a CVE, regardless of safety checks.
Auxiliary Module Search: Identify all auxiliary modules related to a CVE.
Usage:

Install dependencies (ensure Metasploit Framework is installed).
Run: python CVEsploit.py <cve_list_file>
Replace <cve_list_file> with a text file listing CVE identifiers (one per line).
The script queries Metasploit for each CVE, generates separate CSV files for various modules, and stores them in the results directory, labeled with the execution date.
